    üìñ What I Learned

How to build a full-stack project using Next.js + Express.js.

The importance of reusable components like Sidebar.tsx, Header.tsx, and UI elements built with shadcn/ui.

Managing state in React using useState and useEffect.

Implementing login flows, password resets, and OTP verification.

Understanding role-based access control (Admin vs User).

How to connect frontend & backend APIs securely.

     üîÆ Future Improvements

Add task categories or priorities.

Implement notifications for task deadlines.

Improve UI/UX with animations.

Add analytics dashboard for Admin.


    üèó Architecture & Workflow
User Management Flow

Admin Creates User

Admin enters user email, role, and department
System generates temporary password
Welcome email sent to user with credentials


     First Login Process

User logs in with temporary credentials
System detects first login and triggers password reset
OTP sent to user's email for verification


    Password Reset Flow

User enters OTP received via email
System verifies OTP and allows new password creation
User can now access their dashboard with new credentials


     Ongoing Operations

Users perform CRUD operations on their tasks
Admins manage users, departments, and view all tasks
Real-time updates across the application



    üß© Component Architecture
Reusable Components
The application demonstrates component reusability through a well-structured component library:
Core Layout Components

Sidebar.tsx - Navigation sidebar used across all dashboards
Header.tsx - Top navigation header with user actions
DashboardLayout.tsx - Main layout wrapper combining sidebar and header

    UI Components (shadcn/ui based)

Button - Customizable button component with variants
Input - Form input fields with validation states
Dialog - Modal dialogs for forms and confirmations
DataTable - Reusable table component for displaying data
Pagination - Navigation for paginated content
StatusBadge - Color-coded status indicators
SearchFilters - Combined search and filter controls

    Feature Components

PageHeader - Consistent page titles with action buttons
TaskCard - Individual task display component
UserManagementDialog - User creation and editing forms
DepartmentManagementDialog - Department management forms

    Component Reusability Benefits
    The reusable component approach provides:

Consistency - Uniform UI/UX across the application
Maintainability - Changes in one component reflect everywhere
Development Speed - Faster development with pre-built components
Type Safety - TypeScript interfaces ensure proper prop usage

     üîê Authentication System
     Security Features

JWT Token Authentication - Secure token-based authentication
Password Hashing - bcrypt for secure password storage
OTP Verification - Email-based one-time password verification
Role-Based Authorization - Different access levels for admins and users
First Login Security - Forced password change on initial login
